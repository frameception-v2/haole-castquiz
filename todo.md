### Implementation Plan  
Tasks follow numerical order (1 â†’ 9). Dependencies flow vertically:  
1. **Start with Setup** (Task 1)  
2. **Core Features** with mocked data (Tasks 2-4)  
3. **API Integration** for live data (Tasks 5-6)  
4. **Enhance Core Features** with error handling (Task 7)  
5. **Polish UI/UX** with compression and question logic (Tasks 8-9)  

Key priorities:  
1. Functional user flow first (Tasks 1-4)  
2. Real data integration next (Tasks 5-6)  
3. Refinement last (Tasks 7-9)
